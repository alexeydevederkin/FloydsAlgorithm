# FloydsAlgorithm

Robert Floyd's algorithm for sampling without replacement.

Efficiently selects set of ```k``` random numbers from ```n``` numbers with equal probability.

Examples:

Select ```3``` random numbers from ```5``` numbers ```[0, 5)``` = ```[1, 2, 4]```

Select ```5``` random numbers from ```100,000,000``` = ```[34862643, 18068407, 30301144, 92804469, 75385441]```
